# Triage Labels

The skills speak in terms of five canonical triage roles. This file maps those roles to
the actual label strings used in this repo's issue tracker (Linear labels).

| Label in mattpocock/skills | Label in our tracker | Meaning                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `needs-triage`             | `needs-triage`       | Maintainer needs to evaluate this issue  |
| `needs-info`               | `needs-info`         | Waiting on reporter for more information |
| `ready-for-agent`          | `ready-for-agent`    | Fully specified, ready for an AFK agent  |
| `ready-for-human`          | `ready-for-human`    | Requires human implementation            |
| `wontfix`                  | `wontfix`            | Will not be actioned                     |

When a skill mentions a role (e.g. "apply the AFK-ready triage label"), use the
corresponding label string from this table.

## The `hotfix` label (routing, not triage)

`hotfix` is a **type** label, not one of the five triage roles, but it is the one type
label that changes git behaviour: an issue labelled `hotfix` branches off `origin/main`
and targets `main`, instead of the usual `dev` → `dev` (see `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`
§ Hotfix). Agents **must read an issue's labels before creating its worktree** — the base
branch is not something to assume.

Apply it only when production is actually broken *and* `dev` holds work that must not ship
yet. If everything on `dev` is shippable, the fix rides a normal release instead.

In Linear, these are **issue labels**. Find existing labels with
`linear.list_issue_labels` and create any missing one with `linear.create_issue_label`
before applying it via `linear.save_issue`. Note that lifecycle (open → done) is tracked
separately by Linear **workflow states** — these labels layer the triage role on top of
whatever state the issue is in.

## High-risk-path extra caution (this repo)

Treat any issue touching **{{HIGH_RISK_PATHS}}** as **never** `ready-for-agent` by
default — route it to `ready-for-human` unless the issue explicitly says otherwise and a
human has reviewed the plan first.
